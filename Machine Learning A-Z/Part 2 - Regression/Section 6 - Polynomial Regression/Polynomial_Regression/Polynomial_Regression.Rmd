## Polynomial_Regression


**Formula**

$y = b_0 + b_1*X_1 + b_1*X_1^2 + ... + b_n*X_1^n $

**Variable Defination**

* y = Dependent variable(DV).
* X = Independent variable(IV).

$b_1$ = Cofficient for the Independent variable.

$b_0$ = Constant term.

$b_1*X_1^2$ = The Power of x_1 Squred (The curve becomes parabolic it will fit the data better)
```{r=Simple Liner Regression}

```

**Notes**

The Polynomial Regression model is obtained by taking a Linear Regression model in which some of the independent variables are the polynomial features, which makes it a Non Linear Regression model in the end (due to the polynomial features).

We can illustrate this by this schema:

Linear Model => Adding the polynomial features => Polynomial Model = Non Linear Model
